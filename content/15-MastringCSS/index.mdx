Translating Figma designs into actual code can be daunting. This guide will simplify vanilla CSS displays with a focus on Flexbox and Grid, helping you match those perfect designs with precise layouts.

## Origin of CSS

Initially, web pages were simple, text-only sites without flair. With the need for more engaging designs, CSS was born, revolutionizing the aesthetics of websites.

## Basic Structure of CSS

CSS is foundational in web development, structuring content like a pizza box holds a pizza — the box is your browser window, and the pizza is the website content.

## CSS Layout: Flex and Grid

Understanding CSS layout is crucial for efficient UI development. Here’s how Flexbox and Grid can be used to structure your web pages.

### How to Use the Flex Layout in CSS

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method ideal for arranging items linearly, either in rows or columns.

#### Setting Up Flexbox:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Flex Layout Example</title>
<style>
  .flex-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
  }
  .flex-item {
    flex: 1 0 100px; 
    margin: 5px; 
    padding: 10px; 
    background-color: #f2f2f2; 
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="flex-item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="flex-item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="flex-item">Item 3</div>
  <div class="flex-item">Item 4</div>
  <div class="flex-item">Item 5</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>



<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Grid Layout Example</title>
<style>
  .grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    gap: 10px;
  }
  .grid-item {
    padding: 20px; 
    background-color: #f2f2f2;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">Content 1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Content 2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Content 3</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Content 4</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Content 5</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>

How to Use the Grid Layout in CSS
Grid layout divides your webpage into a series of rows and columns, offering precise control over the layout.

Setting Up Grid:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Grid Layout Example</title>
<style>
  .grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    gap: 10px;
  }
  .grid-item {
    padding: 20px; 
    background-color: #f2f2f2;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">Content 1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Content 2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Content 3</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Content 4</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Content 5</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>

Similarities Between Flex and Grid
Responsiveness: Both layouts are fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
Structure: Start by defining the layout on the parent element, then adjust the children elements.
When to Use Flex vs. Grid
Flex: Best for one-dimensional layouts where you want to align items linearly.
Grid: Ideal for two-dimensional layouts where you need precise placement in rows and columns.
Conclusion
Whether you choose Flexbox or Grid depends on your specific layout needs. Both are powerful tools that can help you bring complex Figma designs to life with accuracy and ease.

Happy coding!
