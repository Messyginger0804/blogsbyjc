# Using Slugs in Next.js: A Step-by-Step Tutorial

When building dynamic web applications, handling dynamic routes and URLs is a common requirement. Next.js, a popular React framework, makes this task straightforward with its support for dynamic routing using slugs. In this tutorial, we will explore how to use slugs in Next.js to create dynamic and SEO-friendly URLs for your web application.

## What Are Slugs?

In web development, a "slug" is a short label used to identify a resource, like a blog post or a product. Slugs are typically part of a URL and serve as a human-readable identifier. For example, in the URL `https://example.com/blog/post-title`, "post-title" is the slug.

Next.js allows you to create dynamic routes with slugs to build pages that can handle various content while keeping URLs user-friendly. Let's dive into how to use slugs in Next.js.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following set up:

1. Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
2. Basic knowledge of Next.js and React.

## Step 1: Set Up a Next.js Project

If you don't already have a Next.js project, create one by running the following commands:

```bash
npx create-next-app slug-example
cd slug-example

Step 2: Create a Dynamic Route
In Next.js, you can create dynamic routes by using square brackets ([]) in your file names. Let's create a dynamic route for blog posts using slugs. Inside the pages directory, create a file named [slug].js:

// pages/[slug].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const BlogPost = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { slug } = router.query;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Blog Post: {slug}</h1>
      {/* Add content for the blog post */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default BlogPost;
In this example, we use the as prop in the Link component to specify the slug-based URL. This URL will be shown in the browser's address bar.

Step 4: Run Your Next.js Application
Now that you've set up your dynamic route and created links, you can run your Next.js application:

npm run dev

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see your blog listing page and click on the blog posts to see the dynamic slug-based URLs in action.

Conclusion
Using slugs in Next.js is a powerful way to create dynamic routes and user-friendly URLs for your web application. You can extend this example to handle more complex scenarios and connect your dynamic routes to your data sources.

Remember to explore Next.js's routing and data-fetching capabilities to build robust and dynamic web applications with ease. Happy coding! ðŸš€
